# Grocery-Shopping-Optimizer

## Overview

In South Africa most women visit a grocery at least once a week and every month end  for bulk shopping (News24,  2019). According to  Nielsen 80 percent of these women purchase their groceries from  at least 5 supermarkets at an average expenditure of R220 (News24, 2019).While South African women get paid 30% less than men (News24,2020), they also have longer working hours.  This means that they have less buying power and less time to spend on shopping activities. Team 1 Explore Data Science Interns have created a web application solution to solve these problems for shoppers. 

## Problem Statement

Grocery shoppers struggle to determine the availability of item at grocery stores, and most times do not take advantage of price disparity and promos to get the best deals.

It becomes imperative to develop a service that provides shopper with the most current deals and price information of items to improve their shopping experience and reduce cost.
